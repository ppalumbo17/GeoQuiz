1.  I structured my question class to have multiple constructors in order to allow multiple question types.
2.  The way I structured question 1 had a big impact on how I set up different controlled and view objects.
3.  I had problems calling certain functions as well as a big problem with getting resource IDs.

This project was fun as well as frustrating for some time.  There is a lot more that goes into an app than you
would think.  Some of the big problem I had were with the layout and making everything fit in a decent looking way.
I also had problems after implementing the different types of quetions of only showing the appropriate answer type
for the right type question type.
